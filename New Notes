Wentz Wu does Practice questions daily on his facebook group, had a look on his website, don't seem to have bought it though.

Luke Ahmed - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197 "How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam" - I bought Kindle version of the book - Sold as a way to think sensibly for exam questions

Sunflower Notes - https://www.sunflower-cissp.com/downloads/sunflower_cissp_layout.pdf (Recommended by Thor Pedersen)
- Read notes as a reference - lots of content / refresher

Practice Tests book - Looked through the practice tests book, bought as a bundle with the CISSP Official study guide, did practice questions.

Rest and Sleep - Don't kill yourself on reading everything as the content base is enormous, it would put you off ever taking the exam.
